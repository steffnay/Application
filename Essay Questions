#### *1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?*

My first introduction to programming occurred when I was an 11 year-old playing my very favorite computer game, Dogz 3. This was a fun digital pet game that involved adopting dogs, taking care of them, and watching them grow. Unsatisfied with the limited selection of breeds included in the original game, I searched the early internet for help and eventually stumbled upon a website that described the process of creating new breeds by editing the game’s code. I downloaded the necessary program, taught myself to edit the game code, and imported the new breeds into the game. It was awesome! I loved the way that coding seemed to magically blend two of my favorite interests, math and logic puzzles, with language.

I spent so many hours editing code to create adorable new dogs that it eventually led to an interest in learning HTML. Over the next couple years, I learned just enough HTML to edit small personal websites about my hobbies and interests (honestly, I mostly just showed off screencaps of my new dogs). Unfortunately, I drifted away from coding during my teenage years as my interest in social justice emerged. Because I was unaware of the ways that tech can contribute to social justice, I migrated toward the social sciences. My interest in coding went dormant while I pursued my education in sociology, though I did maintain a casual curiosity for technological advancement.

My interests in social justice and coding merged when I began working as the coordinator of a Science, Technology, Engineering, & Math (STEM) program for girls and gender non-conforming youth. In this position, my previous experience with coding has given me confidence in designing camps that incorporate simple coding activities, like HourOfCode.org. Facilitating these camps has been so fun that it reignited my personal interest in programming, so I recently began trying out Codecademy’s free lessons.

In addition to reconnecting me with coding, my position as a STEM program coordinator has given me the opportunity to meet many women and gender non-conforming folks who do amazing social justice work with their tech knowledge. I’ve now seen many inspiring ways that tech can be a powerful tool in social justice work. I wish I would have known this when I was young!

Learning about the opportunities available in the tech industry eventually made me yearn to go back in time to pursue an education in computer science. I’ve realized that, while I truly love the work that I do now, a career as a programmer will give me more long-term opportunities to do meaningful work that I enjoy. Although I don’t have the means to get a computer science degree right now, I am excited and eager to have the chance to pursue a career in tech by attending Ada.
