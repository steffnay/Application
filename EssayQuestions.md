#### __1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?__  

My first introduction to programming occurred when I was an 11 year-old playing my very favorite computer game, Dogz 3. This was a fun digital pet game that involved adopting dogs, taking care of them, and watching them grow. Unsatisfied with the limited selection of breeds included in the original game, I searched the early internet for help and eventually stumbled upon a website that described the process of creating new breeds by editing the game’s code. I downloaded the necessary program, taught myself to edit the game code, and imported the new breeds into the game. It was awesome! I loved the way that coding seemed to magically blend two of my favorite interests, math and logic puzzles, with language.

I spent so many hours editing code to create adorable new dogs that it eventually led to an interest in learning HTML. Over the next couple years, I learned just enough HTML to edit small personal websites about my hobbies and interests (honestly, I mostly just showed off screencaps of my new dogs). Unfortunately, I drifted away from coding during my teenage years as my interest in social justice emerged. Because I was unaware of the ways that tech can contribute to social justice, I migrated toward the social sciences. My interest in coding went dormant while I pursued my education in sociology, though I did maintain a casual curiosity for technological advancement.

My interests in social justice and coding merged when I began working as the coordinator of a Science, Technology, Engineering, & Math (STEM) program for girls and gender non-conforming youth. In this position, my previous experience with coding has given me confidence in designing camps that incorporate simple coding activities, like HourOfCode.org. Facilitating these camps has been so fun that it reignited my personal interest in programming, so I recently began trying out Codecademy’s free lessons.

In addition to reconnecting me with coding, my position as a STEM program coordinator has given me the opportunity to meet many women and gender non-conforming folks who do amazing social justice work with their tech knowledge. I’ve now seen many inspiring ways that tech can be a powerful tool in social justice work. I wish I would have known this when I was young!

Learning about the opportunities available in the tech industry eventually made me yearn to go back in time to pursue an education in computer science. I’ve realized that, while I truly love the work that I do now, a career as a programmer will give me more long-term opportunities to do meaningful work that I enjoy. Although I don’t have the means to get a computer science degree right now, I am excited and eager to have the chance to pursue a career in tech by attending Ada.


__2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?__

I am a hard worker who finds coding interesting and enjoyable, so in five years I would like to be well on my way to becoming a senior software engineer. I’m willing to travel down a variety of paths to reach this goal, but would prefer to work full-time for either a tech company or nonprofit that promotes social justice. My ideal position will involve creating software that increases democratic engagement and makes government services more accessible to marginalized communities. One organization doing similar work is Code for America, which employs several programmers who I admire and hope to learn from in the future.

In addition to my full-time position, I will either volunteer or work part-time to share the knowledge I gain as a software engineer. I am already dedicated to empowering groups who are underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering, & Math (STEM) through my current work, so I know that engaging these communities will continue to be a large part of my life in five years. My experience has shown me the dire need for mentors who are women and people of color in tech. Because of this, gaining an expertise in software development will allow me to give even more encouragement and support for members of underrepresented communities to also pursue careers in STEM.


__3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?__

My identity and personal values are in complete alignment with Ada’s vision and mission. In terms of identity, I am a Black woman who experienced severe economic insecurity and poverty during my childhood. During my adult years I have worked to support myself while studying race and gender issues as a non-traditional college student. An incredibly small number of people who come from my background ever have the opportunity to pursue a career in technology. This means that I will bring a unique perspective to the tech industry through both my personal experience and my educational background.

My personal values also align with Ada’s vision and mission because I have dedicated my life to striving for social justice. I work hard every day to learn and improve my understanding of anti-oppression so I can help build more inclusive environments wherever I go. If I am accepted to Ada I will put everything I learn into action to change the world with software that empowers oppressed communities.


__4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?__

I have learned from many mistakes in my life, but there is one lesson that I find myself returning to the most often. This mistake occurred during a conversation with my friend Luke while I was attempting to communicate my allyship and support for the LGBTAQI+ community. In this conversation, I expressed that I believed homosexuality was not something that people should be embarrassed of or hide. I flippantly stated, “I don’t understand why people stay in the closet. If you’re gay, just be gay. Who cares?” The look on Luke’s face immediately told me that I had said something offensive and wrong. In an incredibly serious tone, Luke replied, “You have no right to say something like that. You have no idea what terrible things some people go through. Some people lose their whole families because they come out. You have no right to judge them.”

I stood stunned and simply stated, “You’re right. I’m sorry.”

This mistake comes up for me often because I use it to remind myself that I don’t know other people’s struggle. I learned that I can do harm even when I am sincerely trying to stand up for what’s right, so I should never presume to know it all. I also learned to be grateful for the times when others do me the favor of pointing out my mistakes, even though I may be ashamed for having erred. While it was hard to hear Luke tell me that I was wrong, he ultimately saved me from continuing to live with such an ignorant opinion.

If I were to go back knowing what I know now, I wouldn’t make those comments at all. I would understand that people have struggles that I can’t possibly understand and they cope with those struggles in the ways that are best for their individual situation. It’s not my place to judge how others react to oppression that I do not face, so I should simply work to make a more just world while respecting the myriad ways that people choose to survive.
